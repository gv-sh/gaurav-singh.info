I grew up in India, developing an early interest in science and maths, inspired by *A Brief History of Time* and *Cosmos*. This curiosity led me to earn a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science (2008-12) and explore the role of technology in society, prompting me to pursue a postgraduation in Innovation and Experience Design at Srishti (2013-15), where I was introduced to human-centered design (HCD) to understand how technology can be designed for people and perhaps its limitations.

Between 2008 and 2015, I worked as an independent designer, working on competitions hosted by several global companies. From 2017 to 2022, I taught at Srishti-Manipal, focusing on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), mathematics, and programming, bringing ethical and human-centered thinking into my teaching and research. In 2023, I started further studies, building more deeper knowledge in ML. Looking ahead, I am keen on building solutions that bring together ML, HCI, and engineering, shaping a future where technology is responsible and innovative.
