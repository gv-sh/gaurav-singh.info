### Education
2013-15 (2 years, full time): ADP — Innovation and Experience Design, Srishti \
2008-12 (4 years, full time): Bachelor of Technology — CSE, JNTU-A

### Work Experience

_Jul’2022-Present:_ Research assistant to Dr.Zia Javanbakht, Griffith University; To study and use machine learning algorithms to extend an existing method, i.e. ‘Plastic-hinge tracing’ to detect complex deformation mechanisms in re-entrant honeycomb auxetics. Co-authored one manuscript* as the primary author (responsible for project execution and manuscript draft) and two more near completion.

_Jul’2017-Sep’2022 (5 ⅙ years):_ Faculty member and researcher, Srishti Manipal Institute, India; Taught undergraduate and graduate courses in programming, mathematics, and human-computer interaction. At Srishti Manipal Institute in India, he facilitated the Experimental Mathematics Lab and was Head of Studies for the M.Des. - Design Computation program. Supervised undergraduate thesis and papers accepted at international conferences such as CHI, OzCHI, and IndiaHCI. Furthermore, I worked on the design and programming for the posture-sensing module under the supervision of Dr.Naveen Bagalkot (Srishti) and Dr.Tomas Sokoler (ITU Copenhagen). Our efforts culminated in two research papers, and our work was part of INTERACT 2017 at IIT Bombay, India and TEI 2019 at Arizona State University, USA.

_Jan’2018-Nov’2022 (4+ years):_ Design Copilot, Topcoder Inc., USA; Served as one of the Design Copilots for Topcoder, the world’s largest crowdsourcing company with an open global community of designers, developers, data scientists, and competitive programmers. Gaurav has helped onboard new designers for years and engaged with several Fortune 500 companies to facilitate design challenges.

_Feb’2016-Dec’2016 (11 months):_ Research assistant, Srishti; I was part of the Art in Transit team to help students and artists to deploy their projects in metro stations in Bangalore, India. I helped pitch to collaborators and produce for the Festival of Stories in Bangalore in October and December 2016. Supervised by Mr.Abhiyan Humane, Ms.Arzu Mistry.

_May’2014-Jul’2014 (3 months):_ Research Intern, S.Labs; Conducted workshop for faculty members at Srishti to build an understanding of shared ethics and values from diverse practices and pedagogies. Synthesised complex aspects into directions that led us to imagine new information systems. Supervised by Mr.Atul Saraf and Dr.Naveen Bagalkot.
2008-15 (6 ½ years): Independent designer; Worked towards design competitions, commissioned work that includes several global organisations — Topcoder, Fergusson, LendingTree, ShopEzgo, Life Tech., Appirio, Cornell University, Virginia Tech, Humana, Praxair, IBM, EMC2, Honeywell, Brivo Labs, AstraZeneca, Accenture, School of Coding, Air Products and others.
