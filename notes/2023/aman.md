Aman Bhargava is an extremely talented designer and developer anchored towards data visualization. He has a rich background in web development and data visualization. His passion for crafting compelling narratives through data led him to Revivsal Labs, where he currently employs his skills full-time. Aman was at the Srishti Manipal Institute of Art, Design, and Technology, where he pursued a Bachelor of Design, specializing in Human-Computer Interaction. It was during a workshop titled "Mathematics of Magnificent Flora" at Srishti Manipal in 2021 that I had the pleasure of meeting this bright individual. His unique perspective on the intersection of design and technology was evident from the start. 

Aman has since leveraged his talents across various roles, from a freelance Developer at the Centre for Studies in Gender & Sexuality at Ashoka University to a Graphics Intern with Reuters. His ability to transform complex data into intuitive visual stories was further honed through his internship as a Data and Design Fellow at Civic Data Lab. Aman's skill set extends beyond the technical, embodying a deep understanding of the societal and cultural implications of data. His work reflects his belief that data, when visualized effectively, can become a powerful tool for education and change.
