Apoorva Aradhana is a user experience designer adept in combining accessibility, interaction design, research, and sustainability to meet the challenges of modern community living. She is currently pursuing a Master's in Interactive Telecommunications at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts and holds a Bachelor's in Human-Centered Design from the Srishti Institute of Art, Design, and Technology.

Her expertise in crafting holistic user experiences was evident when she presented a paper on "Plural Navigation" at OzCHI 2019 in Australia. As an Accessibility Researcher at Sensorium AI, Apoorva developed voice interfaces and augmentative experiences tailored to neurodivergent individuals and those with cerebral palsy. At IBM, she excelled as a UX Researcher and Designer, where she led research and development projects, enhancing accessibility for clients such as the Trustee Savings Bank, UK, and Metlife, USA.

In her current role as a Teaching Assistant for Intro to Assistive Tech, she offers both technical and conceptual support in accessibility and inclusive design. As a Graduate Researcher at The Ability Project, she is engaged in designing accessible navigation tools for the NYU campus. Apoorva is also known for co-founding Dance2Konnect from 2014 to 2018, a student-led initiative leveraging dance to aid underprivileged communities.

Apoorva's path is distinguished by her strong self-confidence, her willingness to work collaboratively, and her spontaneous approach to naming variables and programs in her programming work. With the completion of her master's degree on the horizon, I look forward to her ongoing contributions to the user experience design field, where her combination of creativity and technical acumen can lead to meaningful innovation.
