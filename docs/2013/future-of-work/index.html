            <h2>Future of Work, 2013</h2>
            <p>The goal of this project, conducted by a team of four students as part of the ADP program at Srishti, was to redefine work experiences for unorganized workers using emerging sensor technologies. The team was divided into two groups, one focusing on enhancing professional growth with assisted tools and technologies, and the other on the social well-being of informal workers.</p>
<p>Informal economies, which include unregulated and untaxed work, account for over half of global employment and an estimated $10 trillion in annual value. In India, the informal sector employs around 425 million workers, or approximately 95% of the workforce. Mobile technology adoption has transformed the lives of many of these workers, increasing efficiency and productivity. This vibrant, innovative environment is characterized by a high elasticity in job roles, rapid adoption of new technologies, and unique problem-solving approaches such as <em>jugaad</em> or frugal innovation.</p>
<p>The project involved extensive research on informal economies and their associated workers. Primary research included interviews and analysis of the daily lives and ecosystems of informal workers, whereas secondary research drew from publications and government papers. Emerging sensor technologies were explored as potential tools to enhance productivity and efficiency for these workers.</p>
<p>The team created a comprehensive understanding of the informal economy and its associated workers by synthesizing information from various sources, leading to the development of a project-specific definition. We identified the importance of mobile technology adoption in enhancing the productivity and well-being of informal workers, and explored the potential of emerging sensor technologies to further support these individuals. The team demonstrated the versatility and innovation present within the informal economy, highlighting unique problem-solving approaches such as <em>jugaad</em> or frugal innovation. The project showcased the value of combining primary and secondary research methods in understanding the complexities and nuances of the informal economy.</p>
