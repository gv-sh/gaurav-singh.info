<p>To study aspects that efficiently improves the posture of physical rehabilitees suffering from posture-related problems due to back issues, using pervasive technology, personal informatics, and the Internet of Things (IoT). The goal is to enhance situated negotiation for exercising in out-of-clinic settings, enabling users to introspect their own body postures during daily chores and exercise, fostering self-reflection and motivation for regular exercise.</p>

<p>Approximately 80% of the population experiences low back pain at some point in their lives, often due to poor posture and lifestyle factors. This project aims to reimagine the artifacts around rehabilitees to engage them in physical rehabilitation exercises and daily chores actively. The target audience includes individuals aged 20-70 years old in urban India suffering from posture-related problems due to back pain or undergoing physical rehabilitation.</p>

<p>I conducted various activities and used design tools to interpret the design brief and define the problem space. Secondary research provided background information and enabled competitor analysis, while primary research involved user interviews to understand real-world challenges and conditions faced by rehabilitees. Key insights and opportunities were identified, followed by rapid ideation, evaluation, and user feedback.</p>

<p>The research revealed several challenges and misconceptions related to exercise and posture, including difficulties in incorporating exercise into daily routines, a lack of knowledge about the importance of posture, and discomfort in being seen while exercising. Data with statistics and numbers were found to be intimidating, and there was a misconception that exercises are only for those who are unfit. The project focused on reconfiguring exercises to address social inhibitions, exploring salient motivators and demotivators, and legitimizing exercises for configurability and substitution. Direct feedback systems for practitioners and alternative mechanisms to provide feedback, such as ambient displays, sound, and haptic feedback, are also incorporated. The solution facilitates exercising and sharing configurability with peers, promoting a seamless and efficient design that addresses the challenges and misconceptions identified in the research.</p>
