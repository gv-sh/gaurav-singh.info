<p><em>S.labs at N2 campus, Srishti</em></p>
<p>In 2014, I met a variety of experiences that shaped my perspective and understanding of my educational journey. These experiences included completing an additional astrophysics course, working on a situated memory project, and exploring the expectations and limitations of the program at Srishti. Looking back, I realized that while Srishti offered numerous opportunities for exploration, it also presented challenges in engaging deeply with specific subjects due to the schedule I can afford as a student at Srishti and multiple competing interests of self. This made me question my decision to pursue a broad range of subjects at Srishti instead of focusing on a narrower range of topics. Despite this, I appreciated the valuable experiences I gained, such as working on the situated memory project, which helped me develop practical skills and an understanding of senior citizens.</p>
<p>To make the most of my academic experience, I found it necessary to balance practical application and in-depth understanding. I hoped for more like-minded peers with similar goals and aspirations. This insight emphasized combining my interests with the program's expectations to maximize my learning potential. As the year unfolded, I struggled to apply the lessons from previous experiences to better my standing. This highlighted the importance of continuous reflection and adapting to new challenges.</p>
<p>During this time, I was able to work on Mathscapes, a space I'm imagining for long-term. In the future, I hope to bridge the gap between the expectations of my academic program and my personal goals by seeking ways to deepen my understanding of subjects that interest me. I will also continue to work on collaborative projects, like the situated memory project, allowing me to apply my knowledge practically and meaningfully.</p>
<p>Although 2014 was not the most successful year in personal growth, it provided valuable insights into the importance of having clear goals and continuous reflection. By learning from various experiences, I discovered my learning preferences, faced challenges within my academic program, and recognized the importance of collaboration. As I carry these lessons into the future, I look forward to pursuing a deeper understanding and meaningful connections with my peers while maintaining a balance between breadth and depth in my educational journey.</p>
