            <h2>Aman Bhargava, Student, 2023</h2>
            <p>Aman Bhargava is an extremely talented designer and developer anchored towards data visualization. He has a rich background in web development and data visualization. His passion for crafting compelling narratives through data led him to Revivsal Labs, where he currently employs his skills full-time. Aman was at the Srishti Manipal Institute of Art, Design, and Technology, where he pursued a Bachelor of Design, specializing in Human-Computer Interaction. It was during a workshop titled &quot;Mathematics of Magnificent Flora&quot; at Srishti Manipal in 2021 that I had the pleasure of meeting this bright individual. His unique perspective on the intersection of design and technology was evident from the start.</p>
<p>Aman has since leveraged his talents across various roles, from a freelance Developer at the Centre for Studies in Gender &amp; Sexuality at Ashoka University to a Graphics Intern with Reuters. His ability to transform complex data into intuitive visual stories was further honed through his internship as a Data and Design Fellow at Civic Data Lab. Aman's skill set extends beyond the technical, embodying a deep understanding of the societal and cultural implications of data. His work reflects his belief that data, when visualized effectively, can become a powerful tool for education and change.</p>
