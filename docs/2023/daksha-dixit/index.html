            <h2>Daksha Dixit, Student, 2023</h2>
            <p>I first encountered Daksha in 2019 at Srishti, where her keen intellect and innovative spirit immediately stood out. It has been an absolute privilege to guide her through her academic endeavors, particularly during her thesis work on &quot;Deciphering Algorithms.&quot;</p>
<p>Daksha's journey into the world of technology and academia is marked by a relentless pursuit to make complex technological concepts accessible to a wider audience. Her thesis, a collaboration with <a href="/students/simran-singh/">Simran Singh</a>, is a pioneering effort that underscores the importance of algorithmic literacy. This work, akin to unveiling the hidden mechanics of a finely tuned clock, equips users with tools to understand the intricate decision-making processes behind digital content recommendations, similar to how a web browser's code inspector operates.</p>
<p>Her project is more than an academic pursuit; it's a vision of a future where digital literacy is a universal skill. Through her adept use of Explainable AI methodologies, Daksha has elegantly bridged the often-imposing gap between the esoteric realms of AI technology and the practical experiences of everyday users.</p>
<p>Beyond her thesis, Daksha's contributions extend to various spheres. Her leadership in the Stanford Longevity Design Challenge and her insightful contributions to OpenIDEO stand as testaments to her innovative capabilities and her ability to inspire and lead. These accomplishments not only highlight her academic excellence but also her potential to drive significant advancements in the fields of technology and human-computer interaction.</p>
