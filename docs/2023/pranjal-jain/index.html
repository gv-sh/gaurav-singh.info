            <h2>Pranjal Jain, Student, 2023</h2>
            <p>Pranjal Jain is a proactive and highly driven design researcher, who I first encountered at Srishti Institute of Art, Design, and Technology during his Masters in Human-Centered Design. His commitment and skill were immediately evident. Pranjal holds an undergraduate degree in Electronics and Communications Engineering from Vellore Institute of Technology, showcasing a diverse and interdisciplinary academic background.</p>
<p>Professionally, Pranjal has accumulated four years of experience leading teams to design digital products and services centered around user needs. He excels in human-computer interaction (HCI), computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW), design research, and the ethics of algorithms. His work demonstrates a profound understanding of technology, customer needs, and business perspectives, ensuring the delivery of competitive and innovative products.</p>
<p>Currently, Pranjal is advancing his expertise by pursuing a Ph.D. at Swansea University, where he is further exploring the intersection of human-machine relationships. His proactive nature and comprehensive approach to problem-solving earmark him as an exceptional talent. I eagerly anticipate his continued growth and recognition as a distinguished researcher and designer in the field of HCI.</p>
