                    <p>2023 was a year of significant challenges and changes, each decision I made influencing the course of my life in unexpected ways. It all started with a major decision and an unforeseen setback that made me rethink my path. In September 2022, I made the hard choice to resign from my faculty position at Srishti-Manipal Institute, largely due to ongoing issues with work assessments and compensation. It felt like stepping into uncertainty, as I didn’t have my next steps planned out. Despite the frustration, I held onto hope, especially after receiving encouragement from Dr. Venkat, who motivated me to consider pursuing a PhD. However, I quickly realized I needed to gather my transcripts from my post-graduate studies—a task I hadn’t thought about in nearly a decade. Getting my ADP transcripts from 2013-15 introduced me to the administrative challenges of academia, but with the support of my mentors, I was able to navigate the process.</p>
<p>Not long after, I encountered a major setback. My application for a PhD was rejected because Srishti’s ADP program wasn’t recognized, despite being equivalent to a master’s degree with a thesis. The lack of a GPA system turned out to be a bigger obstacle than I expected. This rejection wasn’t entirely surprising, but it was still a tough moment, as it highlighted the barriers that come with non-traditional education paths. Then, in November 2022, Simba, our family pet, was involved in a serious accident. His recovery became the focus for our family, and I had to put my academic goals on hold for a while. During this time, I was forced to slow down and reflect, feeling unsure about what the future held as my plans seemed to stall.</p>

<p>However, 2023 also brought a renewed sense of purpose. I decided to focus on producing quality research that could be published. Balancing this with taking care of Simba, I also considered remote work to supplement my savings, though I didn’t manage to figure that out. Conversations with professors from various parts of the world were insightful and showed me how important it is to find a supervisor who truly understands and values my unique academic background. My diverse experiences, especially my post-graduation in design, continued to make things complicated in terms of finding the right PhD opportunities. This phase again taught me the value of perseverance and finding the right fit for my academic journey.</p>
<p>As the year went on, I made a key decision: to pursue a master’s degree in Australia. This decision was driven by both personal and academic factors and felt like an important step in opening up new opportunities. Financial challenges followed, including unsuccessful attempts to secure education loans, but with my family’s support, I was able to gather the necessary funds for my visa application. Moving to Australia marked the start of a new chapter. The first few months at Griffith University were a combination of orientations, coursework, and building new social and professional connections. Immersing myself in the IT program, I began to explore new research areas, excited for what lay ahead.</p>

<p>By the end of 2023, my academic life had taken on a deeper focus. Balancing coursework with developing research ideas, I started formulating potential topics for my thesis and sought guidance from faculty members. I even began drafting my research dissertation proposal, laying the foundation for my future work. As I reflect on the year, I see it as both challenging and rewarding. Resilience became a constant companion, and adaptability was essential. The setbacks and progress I experienced throughout the year shaped me into someone more determined and focused. As I look forward, I feel more prepared to face what comes next, armed with the lessons and experiences that have shaped me this year.</p>
