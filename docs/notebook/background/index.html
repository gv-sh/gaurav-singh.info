                <section class="content">
                    <p>Born in Assam, India, and then grew over multiple locations across India where my early fascination with science, computers, and mathematics was sparked by exposure to influential books like Stephen Hawking's <strong>A Brief History of Time</strong> and Carl Saganâ€™s <strong>Cosmos</strong>. This curiosity led me to pursue a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering, where I gained foundational knowledge in computer vision, algorithms, and image processing.</p>
<p>My growing interest in how technology could address societal challenges inspired me to further my education with a postgraduate program in Innovation and Experience Design at Srishti School of Art, Design &amp; Technology. There, I explored creative problem-solving, blending design thinking with technical skills to tackle real-world problems. This experience solidified my belief in human-centered design (HCD) and ethical technology development. I approach design as a way to embrace the complexity of the world, striving to create solutions that are transparent, accessible, and empowering. Transparency, accessibility, and empowerment are central to my approach to technology development.</p>
<p>My professional journey has been a combination of academia, research, and design. From 2008 to 2015, I worked independently as a designer, where I led Mathscapes, an ongoing initiative to create accessible research tools through mathematics. One of the notable outcomes of Mathscapes was the development of a visual exploration tool for fractals, designed to help users intuitively understand complex mathematical patterns. In 2017, I joined Srishti Manipal Institute as a faculty member, where I facilitated courses in programming, mathematics, and human-computer interaction (HCI). During this time, I co-established the Experimental Maths Lab with Vineeta Rath, promoting interdisciplinary exploration. I also led the M.Des. Design Computation program, mentoring students on projects focused on algorithmic explainability and natural language processing (NLP).</p>
<p>In 2023, I transitioned to Griffith University to further explore the applications of machine learning in engineering, data visualization, and image processing. Throughout my academic career, teaching and mentorship have been key components, where I have worked to cultivate an interdisciplinary mindset among students, encouraging them to think analytically and creatively.</p>
<hr>
<p>My research interests are grounded in applying machine learning to solve practical problems, especially in data visualization and accessibility. I am focused on using machine learning to transform complex datasets into intuitive visual formats, democratizing technology and making it easier for users to engage with data. Additionally, I am invested in algorithmic explainability, ensuring that technological tools are transparent and user-friendly.</p>

<p><em>SnapTag (2014), ReRide (2019)</em></p>
<p>Notably, I was the lead programmer for the <a href="/projects/reride/">ReRide project</a>, which focused on developing personal informatics tools for motorbike commuters, including a posture-sensing module for real-time feedback. This work resulted in research papers presented at INTERACT 2017 and TEI 2019. I also collaborated on the <a href="/projects/situated-memory/">SnapTag project</a>, exploring the use of situated memory to enhance self-efficacy, presented at the India HCI 2014 Conference. My recent work includes collaborating with Dr. Zia Javanbakht at Griffith University on using machine learning to enhance deformation detection in complex materials.</p>
<hr>
<p>Beyond my professional endeavors, I am deeply interested in art and recreational mathematics. I strive to blend these creative pursuits with my research, particularly through visualizing complex concepts in accessible ways. My curiosity about the natural world, science fiction, and the philosophy of technology continuously informs both my academic research and personal projects.</p>
<hr>
<p>Throughout my career, I have received several recognition reflecting my contributions to academia and industry. In 2024, I was awarded the <a href="/notebook/progress-through-stem-professional-program/">Gold STEM Professional ICT Award</a> by Griffith Sciences, acknowledging my efforts in promoting interdisciplinary research and ethical technology development. In addition, I received Adobe Fund for Design grants in 2021 and 2023 for my initiatives in creating accessible tools for research.</p>
<p>In 2017, I was honored as the Design Champion at the Topcoder Open (India Regionals), and I was also a finalist in the Topcoder Open in 2012 (Studio Rank 6) and 2011 (Studio Rank 11) and was invited for the onsite-finals at USA. My role as the co-chair for the demonstration track at IndiaHCI 2018 further reflects my focus to promoting collaboration and innovation within the HCI community. Additionally, earlier in my academic journey, I earned accolades in quiz competitions held by the South Western Air Command in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, securing 2nd place in 2006 and 4th place in 2005.</p>
<hr>
<p>Moving forward, I aim to go deeper into the convergence of machine learning and human-computer interaction. My focus will remain on ethical, human-centered technologies that enhance human experience and algorithmic transparency. By developing intuitive tools for data visualization and image processing, I hope to contribute to a technological landscape that is inclusive, supportive, and empowering for all of us.</p>
