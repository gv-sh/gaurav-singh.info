                    <h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>My personal website is a space for reflection, documentation, and growth. It's more than a portfolio; it's a record of my journey, ideas, and evolution. Unlike social media, which often focuses on fleeting updates, my website is about permanence and control. Here, I own my narrative, shaping it to reflect my growth and capturing both milestones and the journey behind them. This website also serves a broader purpose: to share my process, inspire others, and offer value to those navigating similar creative or professional paths. By documenting my thoughts and projects, I hope to show the value of having a personal space online — a place where creativity, exploration, and learning can unfold freely.</p>
<p>The motivation behind creating and maintaining this website is rooted in the desire for ownership and authenticity. In a world where many aspects of our digital lives are controlled by third-party platforms, this website represents a space where I have full autonomy. It allows me to document my work in a way that feels true to my experiences, without the interference of external constraints. At its core, my website is an evolving archive of my thoughts, creative projects, and professional achievements. It tracks my progress over time, preserving my ideas and documenting how my work has changed. My journal is a key part of this — a place for reflections, technical insights, and creative thoughts. By documenting both the outcomes and the journey, my website becomes an honest representation of who I am, constantly adapting as my interests and perspectives change.</p>
<h3>Design and Freedom</h3>
<p>The design of my website focuses on simplicity, clarity, and personal expression. Unlike social media platforms that enforce design limitations, my website gives me complete creative freedom. I control everything, from typography to layout, ensuring every aspect reflects who I am. It’s a space where I can experiment with visual styles and explore new ways to tell my story. The shift to complete autonomy was fueled by frustration with the constraints imposed by other platforms. I wanted a space that wasn’t limited by the aesthetics of template-driven systems, allowing me to express my creativity in a way that felt authentic. My desire for control wasn't just about visual freedom — it was about being able to tell my story in my own way, without being shaped by algorithms or templates designed for mass consumption.</p>
<p>My website balances technical exploration with storytelling. Sections like Education, Work, Projects, Teaching, and Research present a clear picture of my professional life while keeping a personal touch. The clean design, ample whitespace, and simple typography create an environment that encourages engagement with the content. The focus on design extends beyond aesthetics to the values underlying my choices. I aim for accessibility, inclusivity, and simplicity — making the website easy for others to explore while ensuring that it authentically represents my journey. These values shape every decision, from the tools I use to the way I present content. Looking ahead, I plan to add interactive elements like project visualizations and dynamic interfaces, but my focus will remain on authenticity and independence. My commitment to creative control and personal expression will continue to shape how my website evolves.</p>
<h3>Timeline of changes</h3>
<p><em>2000-2004: Starting with HTML.</em> In 2000, I discovered HTML and Microsoft FrontPage, which sparked my interest in web design. I built simple, static websites, experimenting with creating something that others could access online. This was a time of pure learning — understanding the basics of building and structuring content. The excitement lay in seeing my ideas take shape and be shared. Curiosity led me to explore Macromedia Flash, adding animations to bring life to my designs. These early projects, though basic, were satisfying because they showed me how design could communicate identity and engage people. This period was about discovering the power of the web as a medium for creative expression. The decision to use Flash was driven by a desire to push the boundaries of what I could create and to learn how to make my work stand out.</p>
<p><em>2005-2009: Learning and Growing.</em> By 2005, I began using CSS and JavaScript, which transformed how I approached web design. CSS allowed me to separate content from presentation, giving me more creative freedom and making my designs easier to maintain. JavaScript added interactivity, making my websites more engaging. This period was about growing my technical skills and exploring design possibilities. I started using Adobe Photoshop to create visual elements, inspired by the precision of print media. I also began thinking about my responsibilities as a designer — how to make my work more accessible and inclusive, which became a core part of my approach to user-centered design. The transition to CSS and JavaScript wasn’t just about aesthetics; it was about expanding what I could do. I wanted more than just static pages — I wanted users to interact with my work and see their engagement reflected in the experience. This realization pushed me to deepen my understanding of web technologies and think about design as a way to communicate ideas effectively. It was during this time that I started to see the web as more than just a canvas — it was a tool for storytelling and user interaction.</p>
<p><em>2010-2012: Using CMS Tools.</em> As my life got busier, I turned to content management systems like WordPress, Joomla, and Tumblr. These platforms made it easier to manage content, allowing me to focus on creating rather than coding every detail by hand. WordPress provided flexibility, enabling me to build more complex sites, while Tumblr offered simplicity and a content-first approach. However, I often felt frustrated by the limitations of templates and plugins. The lack of control pushed me to seek alternatives where I could fully express my creativity, setting the stage for a more personalized approach. The convenience of CMS platforms was undeniable, but I realized that convenience came at a cost: I was sacrificing creative control. This realization became a turning point, motivating me to look for a way to manage content that didn’t limit my vision for what a personal website could be. I wanted to create something that was uniquely mine, not constrained by the generic templates or the design choices of others.</p>
<p><em>2013-2019: Moving to Static Sites.</em> By 2013, I grew tired of the fleeting nature of social media and the cluttered design of many platforms. I wanted simplicity, control, and permanence, which led me to explore static site generators like Jekyll. Static sites allowed me to strip away unnecessary features, focusing on content and design using HTML, CSS, and Markdown. The move to static sites was about achieving greater autonomy and a cleaner aesthetic. I embraced minimalism, making sure every element served a purpose. The use of whitespace, structured layouts, and a restrained color palette became central to my approach. This shift also improved performance and security, as the simpler setup meant faster, more reliable websites. This was a turning point — my website became not just a portfolio but a lasting archive that truly reflected my values. (The Creative Independent, n.d.). The transition to static sites was driven by my desire to own every aspect of the website — to create without constraints. It was also a response to my growing appreciation for simplicity: I wanted the website to be fast, secure, and easy to maintain. This period taught me that less is often more, and that meaningful content stands out best when surrounded by simplicity. The minimalist approach was not just about aesthetics; it was about focusing on what mattered most and removing distractions.</p>

<p><em>My website in 2014</em></p>
<p><em>2020-2024: Building My Own Space.</em> In the 2020s, I aimed to balance creative freedom with modern technology. This led me to adopt the Jamstack approach, using Eleventy, Nunjucks, and Markdown. This setup gave me the flexibility to build a highly customized, minimalist website that fit both my creative and technical needs. I began designing directly in the browser, moving away from traditional design tools in favor of a more hands-on approach. (Lupton, 2014). This made the design process more immediate, allowing me to experiment freely. My website became a reflection of my evolving identity — focused, adaptable, and clear in presentation. These changes were driven by the need for balance: embracing new technologies while keeping a personal, human touch. (Walter, 2011). I want my website to be more than a technical project; I want it to be a space that tells my story thoughtfully. (Harvard Business Review, 2021). Emerging technologies like AI, AR, and voice interfaces are intriguing, but I approach them cautiously. I want my site to evolve in a way that feels authentic, ensuring it remains a space for thoughtful engagement and not just a showcase for the latest tools.</p>
