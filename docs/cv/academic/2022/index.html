<p>Looking for research positions in computational mechanics.</p>
<h3>Interests</h3>
<p><em>Primary:</em> Application of image processing and machine learning techniques to engineering.</p>
<p><em>Secondary:</em> High-performance visualization tools, large-sized graphs, optimal graph drawing algorithms, OpenGL or WebGL contexts, algorithmic explainability, natural science, tacit knowledge, human-computer interaction (HCI), artificial intelligence, interaction design, ethical conflicts, open-access knowledge, archiving, accessibility beyond internet, open source, lesser-restricted licensing, recreational mathematics, pedagogy, engaging learning environments, mathematics activities.</p>
<h3>Education</h3>
<p><em>2013-15 (2 years, full time): ADP — Innovation and Experience Design, Srishti</em> Thesis: A study on (a) Chintalayyagarepalle, a remote and off-grid village in India and (b) conceptualising simple devices using Piezoelectric materials to store and use electricity. The thesis was composed in two parts where the first looked at how electricity was used in the region, an off-grid village after it had suffered an electricity outage owing to political unrest. I studied the piezoelectric properties of potassium sodium tartrate in the second part and proposed a method to extract more energy by extending extraction at translational and longitudinal axes under shear stress. Supervised by Dr. Naveen Bagalkot and Mr. Abhiyan Humane.</p>
<p><em>2008-12 (4 years, full time): Bachelor of Technology — CSE, JNTU-A</em> Thesis: Interactive multi-marker tracking in low light or partially obstructed images in realtime. A system for tracking many objects simultaneously, reliably, and accurately in real time was provided. A suitable approach for handling multiple items is needed because the current methods (back then) for tracking a single object do not scale effectively with the number of objects. The novel approach utilises both object detection and tracking, and it illustrates its effectiveness using a number of actual sequences.</p>

ISBN: 9781450361965 (Electronic). doi:10.1145/3294109.3300986. Responsibilities: Gaurav Singh (myself) worked on the design and programming for the posture-sensing module, including the design of visualization for giving real-time feedback to riders. The developed method for posture sensing relied on real-time posture detection using a camera module mounted on the bike dashboard. The work also involved building API and ML based solutions to store user data and visualise data for the users.</p>
