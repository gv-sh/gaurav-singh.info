Co-facilitated with [Dr.Naveen Bagalkot](/mentors/naveen-bagalkot/). This course focused on pushing the boundaries of traditional interaction design beyond screen-based interfaces. Students were challenged to develop innovative solutions for complex problems, utilizing a variety of design methods and tools. The course emphasized the importance of user-centered design and encouraged students to create engaging and immersive experiences that go beyond the limitations of screens.
