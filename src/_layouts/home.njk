<div class="publication" title="iterflow is a zero-dependency JavaScript library that integrates online statistical algorithms into lazy iterator pipelines. Welford's variance, EWMA, streaming Pearson correlation, z-score anomaly detection, and windowed extrema are implemented as chainable pipeline stages that compose with map, filter, window, and take while preserving lazy evaluation and O(1) memory per stage.">
