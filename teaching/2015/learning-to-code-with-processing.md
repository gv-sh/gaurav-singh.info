This course was designed for art and design students who wanted to learn how to code using Processing. Participants learned fundamental programming concepts and how to use Processing's integrated development environment (IDE) to create interactive graphics and animations. By the end of the course, participants had developed programs for creating interactive games and generative art, providing a initial foundation for incorporating coding into their existing practices.
