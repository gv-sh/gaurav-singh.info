This advanced-level course focused on programming and working with IoT-based ideas, sensors, Arduino, and Raspberry Pi. Students were encouraged to identify unique problems and develop their own ideas to solve them. The course also emphasized the use of tangible artifacts to demonstrate proof-of-concepts, providing hands-on experience and practical skills.

Pictures and notes from the exhibition for Tangible Computing studio (Mar 2019) held at Srishti Institute of Art, Design & Technology, Bangalore.

_Projects at display_

_Search Stylus_:
Chinmayee Murugkar, Manasi Kulkarni and Jayanti Dave. The Search Stylus allows readers to identify books of a chosen category with a simple tap on the book. Furthermore, readers can access more information about the book by saving it on one of the many nibs of the pen.

_DrOp Cendu_: Rashi Balachandran, Vanshika Sanghi, Sohayainder Kaur. Tired of overcrowded buses, missing buses daily, or waiting for hours at the bus stop with no information? Drop Cendu erases all your bus-stop anxiety with real-time bus tracking information, automated doors to prevent overcrowding, and fun visuals to make your daily commute comfortable, easy, and anxiety-free!

_TripSpin_: Calvin, Srushti G. A navigation device to make finding a user's desired bus/quickest bus to desired destination easier and more convenient.

_Privacy in ATM_: Ishita Begani, Shalini, Saksham. Have you ever stood in line of an ATM only to discover that all the money is over or only Rs.2000 notes are available? Or you see people peaking into your business unnecessarily while you just want to do a simple transaction? Our solution tackles both of these problems with an automatic enclosure and a visual indicator to show the denominations available in the ATM. The enclosure will get activated at the point during the experience where the user gives out any sensitive information. The visual indicator will show the levels of denominations in the ATM at that point of time and will change after each withdrawal. Our solution caters to the two most important themes that came up in our research â€“ Privacy and Efficiency. In our current Prototype we've only addressed the Privacy Issue with a Flap that comes out every time Sensitive information is exchanged between the ATM and the user.
