This course introduced students to e-textiles and wearables by exploring the LilyPad and Arduino Uno boards. Students learned about the basics of electronics and programming, and how to integrate sensors and actuators into wearable projects using these boards. By the end of the course, students had the skills and knowledge necessary to create their own wearable experiments using these powerful tools.
