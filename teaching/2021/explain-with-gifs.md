In this project, students used GIFs to simplify complex algorithms used on the internet and promote accessibility. Working in groups, they researched popular algorithms in various applications and created 4-8 GIFs to explain concepts related to cryptocurrency or NFTs/digital collectibles in regional languages for an Indian audience. The project was designed as a challenge with specific requirements and constraints. The course provided an opportunity for students to explore the use of GIFs as a means of sharing information and making it more accessible to a wider audience.
