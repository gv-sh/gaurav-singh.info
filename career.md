My professional journey has been a combination of academia, research, and design. From 2008 to 2015, I worked independently as a designer, where I led Mathscapes, an ongoing initiative to create accessible research tools through mathematics. One of the notable outcomes of Mathscapes was the development of a visual exploration tool for fractals, designed to help users intuitively understand complex mathematical patterns. In 2017, I joined Srishti Manipal Institute as a faculty member, where I facilitated courses in programming, mathematics, and human-computer interaction (HCI). During this time, I co-established the Experimental Maths Lab with Vineeta Rath, promoting interdisciplinary exploration. I also led the M.Des. Design Computation program, mentoring students on projects focused on algorithmic explainability and natural language processing (NLP).

In 2023, I transitioned to Griffith University to further explore the applications of machine learning in engineering, data visualization, and image processing. Throughout my academic career, teaching and mentorship have been key components, where I have worked to cultivate an interdisciplinary mindset among students, encouraging them to think analytically and creatively.
