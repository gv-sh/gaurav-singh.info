Hello! Iâ€™m Gaurav Singh, originally from India and currently evolving my expertise in Machine Learning (ML) at Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia. My journey combines together a foundation in computer science with an interest for visual arts and a commitment to creative and ethical practice. My work explores ML within human-computer interaction (HCI) and engineering, with a goal to make data analysis more accessible while considering its societal and ethical dimensions. This focus drives my projects and future ambitions for meaningful technology innovation.

In addition to my computer science background, I've studied Innovation and Experience Design, focusing on creative problem-solving and the societal role of technology. From 2008 to 2015, I worked as an independent designer, developing Mathscapes, a space for creating accessible design tools through mathematics. In 2017, I took a faculty position at Srishti-Manipal, where I taught courses in HCI, mathematics, and programming. My dual roles as designer and researcher have shaped my teaching, offering students unique perspectives on design and technology. In 2022, I left Srishti to pursue further studies, continuing to merge mathematics, computation, and ethics in my work.
