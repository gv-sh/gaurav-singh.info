Born in Assam, India, and then grew over multiple locations across India where my early fascination with science, computers, and mathematics was sparked by exposure to influential books like Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time and Carl Saganâ€™s Cosmos. This curiosity led me to pursue a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering, where I gained foundational knowledge in computer vision, algorithms, and image processing.

My growing interest in how technology could address societal challenges inspired me to further my education with a postgraduate program in Innovation and Experience Design at Srishti School of Art, Design & Technology. There, I explored creative problem-solving, blending design thinking with technical skills to tackle real-world problems. This experience solidified my belief in human-centered design (HCD) and ethical technology development. I approach design as a way to embrace the complexity of the world, striving to create solutions that are transparent, accessible, and empowering. Transparency, accessibility, and empowerment are central to my approach to technology development.
