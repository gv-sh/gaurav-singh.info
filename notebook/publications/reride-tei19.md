Motorbike commuting is the new frontier for exploring digital technology where designing for embodied interaction takes on a more central role. In this paper, building on previous work on embodied self-monitoring, we present our ongoing work of designing a modular platform with a particular focus on real-time estimation and presentation of posture data while riding. In particular, we present "Bike Area Network' (BANk) as a system architecture to help guide the design of such a platform. We share our ongoing work as an invitation for the community of researchers and practitioners of designing for embodied interaction to further explore this new frontier of research.
