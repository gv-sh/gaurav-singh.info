The motorcycle could soon be the new frontier for the exploration of human interaction with advanced digital technology. In this paper we present a demo of a system designed and implemented to explore the design of personal informatics tools for motorbike commuting and help us conduct in-situ evaluation of such tools. We present the system architecture and demonstrate the capabilities of the system by presenting a case instantiation in the form of an interactive soft-and-hardware prototype that collects riderâ€™s posture data, visualizes the data on the motorbike dashboard in real-time, and pushes the data to the cloud server for later retrieval.
