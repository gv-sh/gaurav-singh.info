Co-developed with Suraj Baadkar. To devise a technology-based intervention that supports senior citizens in maintaining independence and self-confidence by harnessing situated memory, fostering self-efficacy, and facilitating the completion of daily tasks. Elderly individuals frequently encounter difficulties performing basic daily tasks due to age-related physical and cognitive decline, including short-term memory impairment. The absence of children and other support networks exacerbates these challenges. This project aims to address these issues by designing a mobile technology solution specifically tailored to the unique needs of senior citizens.

The research team built upon existing studies conducted by another group of students, supplementing their findings with secondary research through academic publications and papers. They interviewed senior citizens to gauge the feasibility of their proposed concepts. The design process entailed ideation, sketching, and concept development on paper, followed by the creation of digital wireframes and the application of visual design elements to the mobile app.

SnapTag, a sophisticated digital assistance system, functions as a companion to aid senior citizens in accomplishing daily tasks by leveraging their situated memory. The app stimulates users to recollect information through contextually relevant prompts without directly divulging the information. The system incorporates five distinctively shaped and colored tags to facilitate the recollection of up to five key objects. The app's micro-interactions are meticulously designed to cater to senior citizens, taking into account their motor skills and potential surroundings.

SnapTag represents a mobile-based intervention designed to help with the self-efficacy and autonomy of senior citizens by capitalizing on situated memory. The app serves as a companion, aiding them in completing daily tasks and subtly promoting memory recall. The project utilized prior research, secondary research, and interviews to inform the design process, resulting in a tailored solution specifically for urban senior citizens who owns mobile phone.
