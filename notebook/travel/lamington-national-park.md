_On the way to Lamington National Park_

Recently, I went on a spontaneous trip to Lamington National Park with some friends, and it was a wonderful experience. It all began when Arpita invited me to join her and Sifa for a day trip to the park. They had also asked Prathap, a mutual friend, to come along. Despite our packed schedules—Prathap had just finished a night shift and had work later in the day, and Arpita had evening commitments—we decided to make it happen. We planned to meet at 7:30 a.m., giving Prathap enough time to rest. That morning, Prathap called around 6 a.m., suggesting we meet at my place after he swung by his home for a change of clothes, just in case we stumbled across a pool to swim in. We reshuffled our plans so that Sifa would pick up Prathap first, then me, and finally Arpita.

We had a minor hiccup with navigation when Google Maps briefly led us off course, but we soon got back on track. Leaving the city behind, we drove through the scenic landscape, passing Hinze Dam and entering the lush rainforest. Tall trees formed a natural canopy overhead, providing pleasant shade, while the winding roads added to our sense of adventure. Upon arrival, we discovered we were at the wrong visitor center, but a helpful staff member quickly redirected us to the correct one nearby. There, we decided on a 3 km trail leading to Gwongoorool Pool. The trail was rugged and steep in places, which made the hike feel more challenging and rewarding. I found myself drifting to the back of the group, content to soak in the surroundings and snap photos at my own pace.

Lamington National Park, located in Queensland, Australia, is part of the Gondwana Rainforests, a UNESCO World Heritage site. Established in 1915, the park is known for its diverse ecosystems, ancient Antarctic beech trees, and a wide range of flora and fauna, some of which are rare or endangered. Named after Lord Lamington, the then-Governor of Queensland, the park spans over 20,000 hectares of subtropical rainforest. It has long been a popular destination for hikers, offering numerous trails, stunning waterfalls, and panoramic views of the Gold Coast hinterland. The area also holds cultural significance for the Yugambeh people, the traditional custodians of the land.

When we reached the pool, the sight of the clear, cold water nestled among rocks was irresistible. Despite the chill, we all decided to take a dip. Arpita, who usually hesitates around water, surprised us by confidently joining in. Sifa and Prathap were quick to plunge in, eager to make the most of it. We spent a good while there laughing, relaxing, and enjoying the serene environment, with small fish darting around our feet, adding to the pool's charm. On the way back, we felt quietly satisfied. We agreed that more spontaneous trips like this were in order. The day reminded me of the joy found in simple, unplanned adventures and the importance of taking time to appreciate nature with good friends. It was a day well spent, and one I hope to repeat soon.
