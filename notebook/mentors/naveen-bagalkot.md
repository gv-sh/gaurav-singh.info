Naveen is a design researcher, educator, and facilitator broadly working at the intersections of Human-Computer Interaction design (HCI), participatory design and community-based care. He is trained as an architect, industrial designer, and holds a PhD in Interaction Design from the IT University of Copenhagen. His work explores alternative possibilities for localized and participatory design of digital-physical-social infrastructures for community care and wellbeing.

As a part of the DesignBeku collective, he focuses on facilitating collaborative design and critical making for and with grass-roots community organizations such as MAYA Health, IT for Change, and Jatan Sansthan. As an educator at Srishti Institute of Art, Design & Technology, Bangalore, he works towards creating an environment of learning that expands the horizon of emerging design practice through a critical and situated engagement with technological ideas and real-world complexities. Naveen has designed and managed (along with others) four postgraduate and two undergraduate degree programs, which lie at the intersection of design, humanities and technology.
