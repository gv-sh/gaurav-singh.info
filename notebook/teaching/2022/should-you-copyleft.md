Participants in the workshop learnt about the principles and background of movements such as self-archiving, anonymous FTP archives, copyleft, foss/floss, FSF, free culture, read-write/remix culture, and open access. Through workshop, discussed the disagreements and tensions between various value-based and apolitical philosophies. The participants were given the chance to read, talk about, and align themselves with one or more of these ideas before writing a paper in response.
