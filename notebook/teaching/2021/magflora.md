In this workshop, participants collected plant specimens and identified patterns of symmetry, arrangement, and growth within them. They used existing LSystem grammars to construct physical 2D/3D forms with paper, sticks, and glue. In the second week, they developed new LSystem grammars to capture patterns from the collected specimens and used them to create physical representations. The workshop provided an opportunity to explore the fascinating world of algorithmic botany.
