The workshop aimed to push the theoretical understanding of the existing roles of digital and technology. Participants were encouraged to take a step back from their individual inquiries and instead focus on the question of how to carry out inquiries related to digital and technology. The workshop provided examples, ideas, methods, and frameworks used to imagine and build futures in relation to computation and technology. It was structured in a challenge-based format with daily challenges and required about 7-8 hours of work per day. There were group activities throughout the week, and participants were provided with ways to move forward in their individual inquiries.
