The course covered the basics of programming using C++. Participants learned fundamental concepts such as data types, variables, control structures, basic algorithms, data structures, and program design principles. Through practical exercises and projects, participants gained a solid foundation in C++ programming, debugging, and problem-solving. The course aimed to equip participants with the skills and resources to continue developing their programming abilities independently.
