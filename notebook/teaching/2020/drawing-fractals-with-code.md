This workshop taught learners how to draw fractals using code, focusing on dimensionality, self-similarity, and iterated function systems. Participants were expected to have basic programming knowledge and experience. The workshop covered topics such as Hausdorff dimension, spatial homogeneity, iterated function systems, and Mandelbrot and Julia sets. It was designed for those interested in mathematical visualization, creative coding, generative art, and patterns in nature.
