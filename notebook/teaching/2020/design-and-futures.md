Co-facilitated with [Dr.Naveen Bagalkot](/mentors/naveen-bagalkot/). This workshop aimed to explore the intersection of design and futures through speculative and critical design practices. Participants were encouraged to reflect on the historical evolution of design as an agent of change and its role in producing social, economic, and ecological inequities. The workshop also examined how design can reconcile with rapidly evolving technology and complex challenges to remain relevant. Through conversations with digital, physical, and social materials, participants explored multiple paths of inquiry in the emerging complex contexts of technology and change. The workshop introduced critical technical practices and focused on innovation and change in the context of history and futures.
