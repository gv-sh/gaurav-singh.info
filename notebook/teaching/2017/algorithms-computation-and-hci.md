This studio explored the intersection of algorithms, computation, and human-computer interaction (HCI) and focused on the theory behind the resources required for various systems, specifically algorithms. Participants learned how to study the efficiency of problem-solving using algorithms and examined the fundamental capabilities and limitations of computers. The workshop provided a space for exploring the relationships between algorithms, computation, and HCI and how they can be used to create efficient and effective designs.
