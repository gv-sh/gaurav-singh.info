Co-facilitated with Dr.Venkat Chilukuri. Programming is most often assumed to be only relevant for software engineers. We look at programming as a design tool, just like a pencil that allows one to interact with digital technologies. This unit introduces this idea of programming as a design tool and how one can get started to play with programming to build prototypes to communicate your design ideas. This unit covers the fundamentals of computer programming.
