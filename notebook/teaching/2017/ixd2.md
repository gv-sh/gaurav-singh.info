Co-facilitated with Riyaz Shaikh. The course was designed for students who had a basic understanding of Interaction design and Human-computer interaction. The course aimed to challenge the students to think critically about the future of computing and technology and how to approach designing for it. Throughout the course, students were constantly presented with thought-provoking questions to encourage thinking beyond conventional methods. The course was structured to enable the students to develop their design skills and knowledge in a collaborative and supportive environment.
