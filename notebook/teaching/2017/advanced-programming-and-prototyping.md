“A programming language is for thinking of programs, not only for expressing programs you've already thought of. It should be a pencil, not pen.” (Paul Graham) Through this unit, we look at advance aspects like Subversion control, APIs, Libraries, Object Oriented Programming, etc. This unit focussed on building complex behind the screen architectures to design with and design for emerging technologies.
