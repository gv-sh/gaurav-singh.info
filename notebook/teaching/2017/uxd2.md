Co-facilitated with Dr.Riyaz Sheikh. The User Experience Design course provided an introductory course for students to explore various aspects of user experience. Through identifying existing and upcoming products and technologies, students were able to analyze consciously designed aspects of user experience and speculate on their future. They utilized Wizard of Oz and other techniques to create prototypes and gauge feedback from their peers, ultimately gaining a deeper understanding of the key elements of user experience design.
