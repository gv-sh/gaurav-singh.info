The workshop aimed to introduce first-year visual communication design students to introductory concepts that emphasize visual modes of thinking. The students were taught to develop multiple anamorphic artwork without pre-planning on paper, but by navigating help from their peers. In the latter half of the workshop, the students learned about Rube Goldberg machines and were encouraged to develop complex machines towards silly use cases through trial and error. The workshop provided the students with an opportunity to explore and enhance their visual thinking abilities, which can be useful in their future design projects.
