In 2018, a group of foundation year design students were taken to the city of Shimoga in Karnataka, India. Their goal was to explore different aspects of field research and community engagement. Along the way, they met fascinating people and visited unique places, like the Sanskrit-only school in Mattur and the cultural institution, Ninasam. They also enjoyed a trek, visited temples, and met majestic elephants at the Sakrebailu camp. Through these experiences, the students gained a deeper understanding of community engagement in the design process. The Shimoga learning expedition was a memorable adventure that fueled their creativity and interest for design.
