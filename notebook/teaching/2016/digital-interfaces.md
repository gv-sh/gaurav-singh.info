This web programming course focused on teaching students how to create engaging websites with interactive features. Students began by learning HTML and CSS to create simple web pages and then progressed to more complex layouts using JavaScript for their portfolio websites. By the end of the course, students had gained valuable skills in web programming and were equipped to create effective digital interfaces with their own creative ideas.
