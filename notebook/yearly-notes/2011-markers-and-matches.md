As 2011 draws to a close, I find myself reflecting on just how much this year has shaped me, especially during these pivotal third and fourth years in computer science engineering. Each day started with the familiar rhythm of commuting to college, but what kept me truly engaged was the deep dive into my thesis project on video marker tracking in variable lighting. The technical complexity of it challenged me in ways I hadn’t anticipated, but there was something creatively fulfilling about it too. It pushed us to problem-solve in real time, and that kept me coming back for more. On days when the project or classes weren’t demanding all my attention, I sought refuge in the library. Surrounded by rows of books, I’d not only focus on my studies but also wander into other topics that sparked my curiosity. I had a close-knit group of friends who made everything feel more manageable, offering support when the academic and social pressures became too much.

Taking on the role of thesis team leader was both an honor and, at times, a weight I didn’t expect. It was empowering to lead, but I also found myself questioning how fair the department's process was for selecting leaders. My team wasn’t always the most technically skilled, but they made up for it in grit and determination. We faced setback after setback, but they stuck with it, and that meant a lot. Our project advisor, though supportive, didn’t provide much in the way of technical guidance. That forced us to take learning into our own hands, which sparked bigger questions in my mind: **Is this system really preparing us for the real world, or are we just learning to navigate around its gaps?**

A highlight of the year was making it to the Topcoder Open 2011 world finals. It felt like a hard-earned recognition of all the hours I’d put into sharpening my design skills. At the time, I wasn’t overly reflective, I was too focused on the next step, the next challenge. But I had this instinct that recording my experiences mattered. These notes became a kind of time capsule, something I knew I’d want to look back on. When I do, I see not just the accomplishments but the small, everyday moments that added up: the camaraderie, the frustrations, the growth.

This year has been a blend of intense academic work, meaningful friendships, and personal growth. I feel a sense of readiness, though I’m not entirely sure for what. Maybe that’s part of the lesson, preparing not just for the future, but for the unknown it inevitably holds.
