My research interests are grounded in applying machine learning to solve practical problems, especially in data visualization and accessibility. I am focused on using machine learning to transform complex datasets into intuitive visual formats, democratizing technology and making it easier for users to engage with data. Additionally, I am invested in algorithmic explainability, ensuring that technological tools are transparent and user-friendly.

Notably, I was the lead programmer for the ReRide project, which focused on developing personal informatics tools for motorbike commuters, including a posture-sensing module for real-time feedback. This work resulted in research papers presented at INTERACT 2017 and TEI 2019. I also collaborated on the Snaptag project, exploring the use of situated memory to enhance self-efficacy, presented at the India HCI 2014 Conference. My recent work includes collaborating with Dr. Zia Javanbakht at Griffith University on using machine learning to enhance deformation detection in complex materials.
